# Agent Note: Capped groups retain their members between applies

Status: implemented

## Problem

A group with `limit` re-ranked its whole pool on every compile. With thousands of
pool nodes and noisy latency samples, a node a few milliseconds faster than an
incumbent evicted it on every probe round: consumers lost a sticky exit, the
compiled YAML changed, and Mihomo hot-reloaded for no real gain.

## Decision

The pipeline gains an optional Retain stage between Sort and Limit
(`internal/pipeline/retain.go`), configured per group as
`source_spec.retain = {margin, min_dwell_seconds}` and only accepted with `limit > 0`
on subscription-sourced groups. Residential channel groups are refused: their exits are
owned by sessions and leases and must stay a separate resource from subscription pools.
Previous members that still pass every predicate and are not quarantined /
disabled / retired keep their seats; a newcomer replaces the weakest unprotected
incumbent only when it is better by more than `margin` in the unit of the first sort
key (ms for latency, points for score; name order never replaces). An incumbent
younger than `min_dwell_seconds` is never replaced.

The previous membership is the table `group_members(group_id, node_fp, joined_at,
last_kept_at, reason)` (migration 41), keyed by node fingerprint and written by the
data plane manager only after Mihomo accepted the configuration, so it always
describes what is actually served. The compiler resolves each group once per
compile (`memberResolver`) so the emitted members, the residential dialer-chain
validator and the recorded membership cannot disagree; the members API runs the
same Retain decision.

## Alternatives considered

- **Plain re-ranking** (status quo): stateless and trivially reproducible, but every
  probe round can swap members by a millisecond, which is the churn this note removes.

- **Hysteresis on the latency samples** (EWMA): smooths noise but still swaps
  members whenever the smoothed order flips, and does nothing for score order.
- **Writing membership during compile**: compile must stay a read of desired state;
  a compile that is then rejected by Mihomo would poison the next retention.
- **Keying by node id**: a subscription refresh can re-create the row of the same
  physical node, which would reset `joined_at` and defeat min dwell.

## Consequences

Retention is opt-in, so existing groups compile exactly as before. A Retain group's
output depends on stored history, desired state and the current time: once an
incumbent's min dwell elapses a better newcomer may replace it without any other
input changing. A per-bucket cap is enforced inside Retain, not before it, so an
incumbent is not dropped by the cap before Retain can keep it; a challenger whose
bucket is full may only replace the weakest replaceable incumbent of its own bucket.
The replacement test is written positively (`challenger - incumbent > margin`), so a
NaN difference (two nodes without a latency sample) never replaces anyone, and score
weights are bounded to finite values in [0, 1e6] so scores stay finite. When recording
the applied membership fails, the failure is logged and the compiler keeps that
membership in memory as pending, with each member's join time carried from the
previous applied membership (a member that left and came back joins anew); later
compiles retain from it until a write succeeds. fill / best modes, L2 tag probes and per-group
snapshot ETags are not part of this change.

## Testing

internal/pipeline/retain_test.go (margin, min dwell, quarantine, parity with Run,
validation), internal/pipeline/retain_edge_test.go (full-bucket challenger, NaN
metric, weight bounds), internal/store/group_members_test.go (join time kept, leavers removed,
cascade), internal/proxygroup/retain_test.go, and
internal/dataplane/mihomo/compiler_members_test.go (compile -> record -> compile keeps
the incumbent inside the margin and swaps beyond it).
